## Inspiration

While gaining some hands-on experience, our team members realized that, even in today’s “interconnected” society, finding suppliers for diverse companies took an agonizingly long time and an incredible number of resources. In a world that moves that quickly and shape-shifts even faster, being able to cover your foundations as a business owner at its pace is non-negotiable. ProveIA was born out of the frustration of occupying golden time in a task that could be fixed with some internet and a lot of courage.

## What it does

ProveIA focuses on searching and matching different suppliers for the same product near a business owner. It checks for location, budget, response time, and other parameters to ensure that every entrepreneur out there gets the best option available on the market. This is done by profiling the user and its necessities to fit the supplier’s abilities like a glove.

## How we built it

First, find a database with enough information about suppliers in the country to extract and match with our users’. In this case the Mexican’s government INEGI’s database was used. Then, use an API to extract the location and connect with AI to receive the prompt from the user and filter through the list of suppliers. Last, work in an interface that was easy for the user to navigate and that would stand out from other websites in the market.

## Challenges we ran into

The first major problem we encountered was that most API’s that would provide us with good and filtered information were only available after payment. This meant that we would have to find more creative ways to obtain the information we needed. Another wall we ran into was that most necessary resources were incredibly deep in the internet. This only further proves our point that this side of business is constantly undermined and ignored. Last problem would be trying to balance the absolute musts and the over-the-top greedy features that would cost us valuable time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are incredibly proud of the way we worked as a team and agreed to turn in our best work regardless of whether it would be worthy of recognition or not. We are proud of finding great databases, successfully calling both API’s, integrating AI in a natural way, using a fully hand-made interface, and contributing to spreading the word about ways to decrease production time in a business.

## What we learned

Some of us worked with new tools and adapted fairly quickly to them. Others expanded their horizons while taming unexplored software tools. And even through all of that, we still had time to laugh until we cried and have the occasional mid-hackathon crisis. We learnt to trust in our team members abilities and support the changes most of us deemed appropriate. But, most importantly, we learnt that even the highest of walls can be climbed with some research and back up. 

## What's next for ProveIA

We would love nothing more than to see ProveIA be the go-to tool entrepreneurs of all sizes, experiences and places used and relied on to optimize their business. For us, it is not about being the biggest or shiniest, it is about being the most reliable and useful. Therefore, we want to work to keep it as low-cost as possible and accessible in different parts of the country, perhaps even the world.
